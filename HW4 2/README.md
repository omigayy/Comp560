=======

- All codes tested and work fine
- in order to run this code the computer has to have libSVM installed and 
- a folder named images with class data in the directory
- parameter could be changed in line 41
	+ -t = 0 for linear kernal
	+ -t = 2 for RBF kernal
- switch features (tinyimage or colorhistogram) by changing line 66 and 133
- change whether to include a None class by comment out either line 161 or line 162-165
- other comment section are used for store model or list so that don't have to build models every time
